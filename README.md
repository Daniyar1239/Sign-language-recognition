## An american sign language recognition task using CNN and machine learning algorithms

This project aims to resolve the American Sign Language classification task using deep and machine learning algorithms. The CNN model has been taken from this project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/madz2000/cnn-using-keras-100-accuracy/notebook - to compare its performance with several machine learning algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier, which have been implemented in this project. 

You can download the dataset from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist

It is an American Sign Language, which looks like this:
